# Slider Puzzle

## The challenge:

* If you’re unfamiliar with the 15 Puzzle, [read up on it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) and make sure you have a good understanding of what it is. This test adapts that puzzle to an 8-tile variant.

* No markup changes are allowed inside the body tag in the puzzle/index.html file.

* Do not use any front end libraries or frameworks for any of the tasks except when explicitly noted.

* Make the puzzle work with the same interaction model as the original puzzle had.
  - The application logic cannot be in global scope.
  - Write comments throughout your application structure and logic. The degree of commenting that you do is up to you, but more importantly we want to be able to “read through” your thought process.

* Style the puzzle to look exactly like the screenshot image.
  - Any valid CSS is permitted.
  - Across browsers, the puzzle should look the same or very close to the same.
  - The mobile screenshot demonstrates the initial scale of the page.
  - The user should be able zoom the page and styling should not break.

* Cannot create a “blank” tile to fill the empty space in the puzzle.
